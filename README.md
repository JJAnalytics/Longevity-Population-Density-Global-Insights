# Longevity & Population Density Global Insights (Created using MYSQL Workbench, MS Excel & Power BI)

## Overview
Sourced from the SQL community, this database offers detailed information on countries and continents, including life expectancy, population, languages spoken, capitals, and surface area. My aim is to explore whether factors such as population density and multilingualism influence longevity and offer insights for researchers interested in global health.

## Dataset
<a href="https://github.com/JJAnalytics/Longevity-Population-Density-Global-Insights-/blob/main/sakila-data.sql">The SQL data set.</a>

<a href="https://github.com/JJAnalytics/Longevity-Population-Density-Global-Insights-/blob/main/Extracted%20Tables.xlsx">The CSV files exported.</a> 


## Questions (KPIs)
-	Life Expectancy vs. Population Density?
-	Are countries with more bilingual or multilingual populations performing better in life expectancy?

## Cleaning & Transformation
-	The information was extracted using SQL
-	Calculated Population Density.
-	Created new Columns.
-	Renamed Columns.
-	Joined tables.
-	Corrected data types.
-	Removed Null values.
-	Created a relationship between tables.

## Additional Screenshots

## Insights & Recommendations
- The analysis reveals that high population density does not always correlate with a lower life expectancy.

  In areas with lower life expectancy, research into healthcare, welfare systems, access to nutritious food, and effective 
  public health policies should be conducted to enhance quality of life.

- Life expectancy is shaped by various factors beyond language diversity, as some countries with higher multilingual populations still experience lower life expectancy.

  Social and economic inequalities must be addressed to ensure everyone has access to essential services and resources.

## Limitations & Potential Solutions
- Many regions with lower life expectancy may lack the financial and infrastructural resources needed to improve healthcare, welfare systems, and public health policies.

  Governments and organizations could collaborate with international bodies to provide funding, expertise, and resources to 
  areas in need.

- Economic pressures like inflation or trade barriers can limit access to nutritious food, quality healthcare, and essential services.

  Governments and organizations can promote sustainable agriculture and food security to ensure a steady supply of 
  nutritious food, while encouraging local production to reduce reliance on imports.

## Summary
The analysis shows that high population density doesnâ€™t always result in lower life expectancy. Improving healthcare, welfare, nutrition, and public health is key in areas with lower life expectancy. Additionally, life expectancy is influenced by factors beyond language diversity and addressing social and economic inequalities is crucial for ensuring equal access to essential services.
