# Longevity & Population Density Global Insights (Created using MYSQL Workbench, MS Excel & Power BI)

## Overview
Sourced from the SQL community, this database offers detailed information on countries and continents, including life expectancy, population, languages spoken, capitals, and surface area. My aim is to explore whether factors such as population density and multilingualism influence longevity and offer insights for researchers interested in global health.

## Dataset
<a href="https://github.com/JJAnalytics/Longevity-Population-Density-Global-Insights-/blob/main/sakila-data.sql">The SQL data set.</a>

<a href="https://github.com/JJAnalytics/Longevity-Population-Density-Global-Insights-/blob/main/Extracted%20Tables.xlsx">The CSV files exported.</a> 


## Questions (KPIs)
-	Life Expectancy vs. Population Density?
-	Are countries with more bilingual or multilingual populations performing better in life expectancy?

## Cleaning & Transformation
-	The information was extracted using SQL
-	Calculated Population Density.
-	Created new Columns.
-	Renamed Columns.
-	Joined tables.
-	Corrected data types.
-	Removed Null values.
-	Created a relationship between tables.
